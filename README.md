  ## Design

  ### Colour Scheme

![image of the colour scheme](documentation/colour-scheme.png)

The choice of my color scheme was based on the colours of the chess board. To give a total feel of the game I considered these colours are best apropriate. As for the lightgrey, I implemented it for the variety, and a better feel for the user.

### Typography

I went for a Google 'Oleo Script' in the title and main text because it gave a feeling of old, as the game that the users love. As for the rest of the page i went for the standard 'Sans Serif' because i think it is easyer for the user to read and also not to give the feeling that the page is too charget.
